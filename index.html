        <h1>Exploring the role of VR in Making</h1>
        <p>What role could, and should VR play in supporting the development of maker skills? Are the skills involved in making enhanced by exposure to immersive VR systems, or is VR the anthithesis of
        the making process?</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>This NSF-funded project is exploring the relationship between VR and making. On the face of it, these may be seen as two completely unrelated topics: one highly tangible, and
              and the other existing in a purely digital realm. However, it seems likely that designing objects will take advantage of digital capabilities, and therefore the whole process of
            making, both for fun, and for profit, may be influenced by these trends.</p>
            <p>Although this site will initially concentrate on the experiments with VR, the project is also exploring the role of telepresence and remotely controlled robotics. In particular
            the team wants to understand how these tools might help to bridge the geographic divide between students in rural environments, and instructors based in urban centers.</p>

            <p>On the face of it, one would think that the answer to this question is very clear. Start with an idea, end up with a tangible object. However, the rise of digital tools,
              and particularly VR, opens up entirely new ways of 'making'. Does producing these digital objects confer the same benefits?

            <p>Humans have been creating objects for both practical, and artistics purposes, for millennia. In recent years, there has been a much greater interest in the educational
            benefits - beyond skill acquisition - of engaging in making.</p>
