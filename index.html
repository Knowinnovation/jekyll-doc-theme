        <h1>Exploring the role of VR in Making</h1>
        <p>What role could, and should VR play in supporting the development of maker skills? Are the skills involved in making enhanced by exposure to immersive VR systems, or is VR the anthithesis of
        the making process?</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>	The NSF Funded Nebraska Innovation Maker Co-Laboratory (NiMC) project advances a high-risk model of connectedness and social innovation. This project focuses on using two main strategies; a) virtual collaborative spaces and b) robotic telepresence, to provide rural youth access to the Maker movement. This high-risk model will provide a replicable strategy of reaching rural underserved youth audiences within their communities so that they may establish wider learning communities with experts and mentors and thereby fully participate in the maker experience.
                </p>
                <p>We will use this website to both describe our progress, and publicise our findings. 
                </P>

            <p>On the face of it, one would think that the answer to this question is very clear. Start with an idea, end up with a tangible object. However, the rise of digital tools,
              and particularly VR, opens up entirely new ways of 'making'. Does producing these digital objects confer the same benefits?

            <h3 class="text-center">Making & Learning</h3>
            <p>Humans have been creating objects for both practical, and artistics purposes, for millennia. In recent years, there has been a much greater interest in the educational
            benefits - beyond skill acquisition - of engaging in making.</p>
